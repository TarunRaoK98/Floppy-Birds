# Floppy Birds

Floppy Birds is a remake of the very the Android game Flappy Birds.<br>
A few points to keep in mind for easier search and usage :
- The src folder contains all source code files. The root repo also does, but for the sake of convinience I've also placed the source code in the src folder.
- The game lags on Ubuntu 16.04
- To run the code, you could just clone the repo and open the terminal in after "cd Floppy-Birds" and then compile the code here itself as all the source code files are here too and you need not go to src folder.

## To compile, you could use the following command
    javac -d . FloppyBird.java GamePanel.java MenuPanel.java Bird.java Wall.java

## To run the code, just type
    java floppyBirdPackage.FloppyBird
